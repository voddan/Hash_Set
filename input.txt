Produce
debugging
information
in
the
operating
system's
native
format
(stabs,
COFF,
XCOFF,
or
DWARF
2).
GDB
can
work
with
this
debugging
information.
On
most
systems
that
use
stabs
format,
-g
enables
use
of
extra
debugging
information
that
only
GDB
can
use;
this
extra
information
makes
debugging
work
better
in
GDB
but
probably
makes
other
debuggers
crash
or
refuse
to
read
the
program.
If
you
want
to
control
for
certain
whether
to
generate
the
extra
information,
use
-gstabs+,
-gstabs,
-gxcoff+,
-gxcoff,
or
-gvms
(see
below).
GCC
allows
you
to
use
-g
with
-O.
The
shortcuts
taken
by
optimized
code
may
occasionally
produce
surprising
results:
some
variables
you
declared
may
not
exist
at
all;
flow
of
control
may
briefly
move
where
you
did
not
expect
it;
some
statements
may
not
be
executed
because
they
compute
constant
results
or
their
values
are
already
at
hand;
some
statements
may
execute
in
different
places
because
they
have
been
moved
out
of
loops.
Nevertheless
it
proves
possible
to
debug
optimized
output.
This
makes
it
reasonable
to
use
the
optimizer
for
programs
that
might
have
bugs.
The
following
options
are
useful
when
GCC
is
generated
with
the
capability
for
more
than
one
debugging
format.
