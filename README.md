Hash_Set
========
/*
 * This is an exapmle of implementation of a hash set.
 * 
 * The main task is to find out the most critical part of the program
 * and to optimase it with ASM language.
 * 
 * Recomended profilers are: valgrind (callgrind), prof (gprof)
 * 
 * Functionality:
 * 	1) remembers a number (int)
 * 	2) answers if there was such a number before
 * 
 * Note that it is an educational project, so the main goals are:
 * 	Simplicity
 * 	Development time
 * 	Visibility
 * 
 * In particular I am going to block some gcc optimisations
 * in order to simplify the asm optimisation.
 *

 The project is developed by Daniil Vodopian as a part of one-semester course of assembly language at MIPT, Moscow, Russia
